# Blackbird - OpenBSD network sniffer from 2001

My first network-related project that has been coded at the beginning of my career in 2001. Blackbird is a packet sniffer developed initially on the OpenBSD UNIX system and later ported to IBM AIX Unix and Linux. This was the very project that started my networking career. No active development is happening. Just a vintage curiosity from times when Wireshark was called EtherReal. Named after the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane :)

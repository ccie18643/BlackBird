# Blackbird - OpenBSD network sniffer from 2001

My first network related project back from 2001. Blackbird is a packet sniffer developed originally on OpenBSD UNIX system and later ported to IBM AIX and Linux. This was the very project that started my networking career. No active development, just more like vintage curiosity from the times when Wireshark was called EtherReal. Named after SR-71 Blackbird spy plane :)
